> “I'm already atomic.”

Welcome to my digital command center.  
I don’t just *learn* tech, I *interrogate* it. Break it. Rebuild it smarter.

### 🧬 What I'm Engineering Right Now:
- Learning crazy stuffs and being psychotic with the world.
- Building tools that blend **Python**, **cybersecurity**, and **intelligence gathering**.
- Training in **offensive security** while designing systems that **defend silently**.
- Deep diving into the *entire* CS spectrum , from compilers to cloud exploits.
- Architecting systems with precision , bridging logic, security, and creativity.

### 🧭 My Philosophy:
> **“Be water.”**  
> Adapt. Flow. Find the cracks. And when needed , flood the system.

### 🧰 Toolbelt Includes:
- Learning the tech world not to *catch up*, but to *outthink*.
- I value systems thinking, deep dives, and building things most don’t dare touch. (well I'm not flexing here I just thought it's cool to write don't mind me 🥺)

### 📁 Projects That Don’t Fit in a Box:
> Don’t expect less. Just wait.  
The real stuff is loading , quietly, cleanly, and with intent.

### 📡 Signal Boost (Connect):
• [Email](mailto:creating@agoodmail.com)  - Why wait check my bio for my socials. Discord @eminence.yash
- [Coffee](https://www.bit.ly/yash22upon7) - I'm so tired need immediate caffeine
(But really, grep my commits for who I am.)

### 🧠 Fun Fact:
While you were reading this, I was learning how to bend systems to my will. (well I said too much but that what I'm really doin maybe)

> ⚡ “Beginner” is a mindset. I prefer *perpetual alpha build.* (parenthesis represents my emotions don't read if you're looking professionality and I know I'm late to tell you this)
