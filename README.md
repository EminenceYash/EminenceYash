> “I'm already atomic.”

Welcome to my digital command center.  
I don’t just *learn* tech — I *interrogate* it. Break it. Rebuild it smarter.

### 🧬 What I'm Engineering Right Now:
- Learning crazy stuffs and being psychotic with the world.
- Building tools that blend **Python**, **cybersecurity**, and **intelligence gathering**.
- Training in **offensive security** while designing systems that **defend silently**.
- Deep diving into the *entire* CS spectrum — from compilers to cloud exploits.
- Architecting systems with precision — bridging logic, security, and creativity.

### 🧭 My Philosophy:
> **“Be water.”**  
> Adapt. Flow. Find the cracks. And when needed — flood the system.

### 🧰 Toolbelt Includes:
- Learning the tech world not to *catch up*, but to *outthink*.
- I value systems thinking, deep dives, and building things most don’t dare touch. (well i'm not flexing here I just thought it's cool to write don't mind me 🥺)

### 📁 Projects That Don’t Fit in a Box:
> Don’t expect less. Just wait.  
The real stuff is loading — quietly, cleanly, and with intent.

### 🧠 Fun Fact:
While you were reading this, I was learning how to bend systems to my will. (well I said too much but that what I really think)

> ⚡ “Beginner” is a mindset. I prefer *perpetual alpha build.* (paranthesis represents my emotions don't read if you're looking professionality and I know I'm late to tell you this)
